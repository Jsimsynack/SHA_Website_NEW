        Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, led the nation through its most tumultuous period, the 
        Civil War, and played a crucial role in the emancipation of enslaved people. 
      </p>

      <div id="moreText" class="hidden-content" style="display: none;">
      <p>
        Born in 1809 in Kentucky, Lincoln rose from humble beginnings to become one of America’s most revered leaders. His 
        presidency was defined by his commitment to preserving the Union and his belief in democracy and self-government. 
        Through his leadership, the nation not only survived the Civil War but also took significant steps toward ending 
        slavery, solidified by the Emancipation Proclamation and the eventual passage of the 13th Amendment. <br><br> Lincoln’s 
        legacy endures due to his eloquence, humanity, and dedication to the principles of freedom and equality. His assassination 
        in 1865 only added to his status as a national martyr. The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., dedicated in 1922, stands 
        as a lasting tribute to his contributions. While his racial views and political strategies have been the subject of 
        continued scholarly debate, his role as the savior of the Union and advocate for democracy remains central to his 
        legacy. His words and actions continue to inspire generations, making him one of the most studied and admired figures 
        in American history

        Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist and former Nazi Party member, is best known for saving approximately 
        1,200 Jewish lives during the Holocaust. 
      </p>

      <div id="moreText" class="hidden-content" style="display: none;">
      <p>
        His story gained global recognition through the 1982 novel Schindler’s Ark and the 1993 film Schindler’s List. 
        Despite his affiliations with the Nazi regime, Schindler ultimately used his influence and resources to protect 
        Jewish workers in his factories from deportation and extermination. His actions transformed him from an 
        opportunistic businessman into one of history’s most famous "Righteous Gentiles," recognized for his moral 
        courage during one of humanity’s darkest times. <br><br> Born in 1908 in what is now the Czech Republic, 
        Schindler came from a privileged Catholic family but struggled with personal and financial failures. 
        By the outbreak of World War II, he had embraced a life of opportunism, engaging in black-market dealings 
        and leveraging connections with Nazi officials to acquire a factory in occupied Poland. Initially motivated 
        by profit, he exploited Jewish labor as a cheap workforce. However, as the horrors of the Holocaust unfolded, 
        Schindler underwent a transformation, risking his wealth and life to protect his Jewish workers. His legacy 
        remains a powerful testament to how human decency can emerge even in the most unlikely circumstances.

        Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. played a pivotal role in the American Civil Rights Movement, leading efforts for racial equality 
        from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. 
      </p>

      <div id="moreText" class="hidden-content" style="display: none;">

        In just under 13 years, his leadership helped African Americans achieve more progress toward civil rights than had been accomplished 
        in the previous 350 years. As a strong advocate for nonviolence, Dr. King drew inspiration from his Christian faith and Mahatma 
        Gandhi’s teachings to lead a movement based on peaceful protests, civil disobedience, and grassroots organizing. Rather than 
        resorting to violence, he used the power of words and nonviolent action to push for legal equality, eventually expanding his 
        activism to address issues of poverty and global conflict. <br><br>Dr. King’s legacy endures through his powerful speeches and writings, 
        including the iconic “I Have a Dream” speech, his Nobel Peace Prize lecture, and “Letter from a Birmingham Jail.” 
        His influence is widely recognized, with his teachings being studied across the world and honored in numerous ways. 
        He remains the only non-president to have a national holiday in his name and a memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. 
        His impact continues to be felt through countless statues, parks, streets, and public institutions dedicated to his memory, 
        reinforcing the lasting relevance of his message of equality and justice for all.

        Harriet Tubman, born Araminta Ross in 1822, was an enslaved woman who overcame immense hardships to become a leading figure in the fight for freedom.  
      </p>

      <div id="moreText" class="hidden-content" style="display: none;">
      <p>
        After suffering a traumatic head injury that caused lifelong seizures and visions, Tubman found strength in her faith and resilience. Determined to escape slavery, 
        she successfully fled to Pennsylvania in 1849. Instead of remaining in safety, she became a conductor on the Underground Railroad, leading approximately 70 enslaved 
        individuals, including her family, to freedom. Despite the dangers, she navigated treacherous landscapes and outwitted slave catchers, earning the nickname “Moses” 
        for her unwavering dedication to liberation. Tubman’s efforts intensified after the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which prompted her to lead numerous missions to Canada, 
        ensuring the long-term safety of those she rescued. <br><br> Beyond her work on the Underground Railroad, Tubman played a significant role in the American Civil War 
        as a Union Army scout, spy, and nurse. She led the successful Combahee River Raid, which freed 750 enslaved people, making her the first woman in U.S. history to 
        command a military operation. After the war, she settled in Auburn, New York, where she continued her activism by supporting the women’s suffrage movement and 
        establishing a home for the elderly and disabled. Tubman’s contributions to American history remain monumental, and she is celebrated as a symbol of courage, r
        esilience, and justice. Her legacy continues to inspire generations, proving that the pursuit of freedom and equality is an enduring fight

         After his father's death, he was placed under the guardianship of Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo, who provided him with an education. 
         Mandela’s academic journey took him from primary school in Qunu, where he was given the name "Nelson," to institutions like Fort 
         Hare University and the University of Witwatersrand, though he faced challenges completing his studies. His political activism 
         emerged in the 1940s when he joined the African National Congress (ANC) and co-founded the ANC Youth League. In 1952, he helped 
         launch the Defiance Campaign, was arrested under the Suppression of Communism Act, and co-established South Africa’s first Black-owned 
         law firm with Oliver Tambo. Despite government restrictions, he remained a key figure in the struggle against apartheid, ultimately 
         facing arrest in 1956 during the Treason Trial, which lasted until 1961. <br><br> Mandela’s activism escalated following the 
         Sharpeville Massacre in 1960, leading him to co-found Umkhonto weSizwe, the ANC's armed wing, in response to the apartheid regime’s 
         brutality. He was arrested in 1962 and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 after the Rivonia Trial. During his 27 years in 
         prison, he became the global symbol of the anti-apartheid movement. Released in 1990, he played a pivotal role in negotiations 
         to end apartheid and unify South Africa. In 1994, he became the country’s first Black president, championing reconciliation and 
         democracy. His legacy as a leader, peacemaker, and human rights advocate endures worldwide, inspiring movements for justice and equality.

        His grandfather served as a colonel during the War of 1812, and Chamberlain himself pursued academia, attending Bowdoin College and 
        studying under Calvin Stowe, husband of Harriet Beecher Stowe. After graduating in 1852, he continued his education at Bangor Theological 
        Seminary. Chamberlain joined the faculty of Bowdoin College, teaching rhetoric and modern languages, and was proficient in multiple languages, 
        including French, Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac. In 1855, he married Fanny Adams, with whom he had two surviving children, Grace and Harold.​ <br><br>
        With the onset of the American Civil War, Chamberlain enlisted in the Union Army, rising to prominence as commander of the 20th Maine Volunteer 
        Infantry Regiment. He is best known for his leadership during the Battle of Gettysburg, particularly in defending Little Round Top, a feat that 
        earned him the Medal of Honor. After the war, Chamberlain served four terms as Governor of Maine and later returned to academia as President of 
        Bowdoin College. He remained active in veterans' affairs and authored several works on his wartime experiences. Chamberlain passed away in 1914 
        and is remembered as a distinguished soldier, educator, and public servant.

        George Washington, born on February 22, 1732, in Virginia, emerged from a privileged background to become a central figure in American history.

        Without formal higher education, he gained practical experience as a surveyor and later demonstrated leadership during the French and Indian War 
        as the leader of the Virginia Regiment. His political career included serving in the House of Burgesses, and his military expertise led to his 
        appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Washington's strategic acumen was instrumental 
        in securing American independence. ​ <br><br> Following the war, Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787, contributing 
        significantly to the drafting of the U.S. Constitution. In 1789, he was unanimously elected as the first President of the United States, 
        setting numerous precedents for the new government. After serving two terms, Washington retired to his Mount Vernon estate, where he spent 
        his remaining years until his death on December 14, 1799.

        Susan B. Anthony was a pivotal figure in the women's suffrage movement.    
      </p>

      <div id="moreText" class="hidden-content" style="display: none;">
      <p>
        Born in 1820, she dedicated much of her life to advocating for women's rights, including their right to vote. 
        Her efforts were instrumental in organizing campaigns, creating petitions, and delivering speeches to gain support 
        for gender equality. <br><br> Although she did not live to see the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, 
        Anthony’s tireless work laid the groundwork for women's suffrage in the U.S., cementing her place as a central 
        figure in the movement.

        Isaac Newton, born in 1642 in England, made monumental contributions to science, particularly in physics, mathematics, and astronomy.     
      </p>

      <div id="moreText" class="hidden-content" style="display: none;">
      <p>
        Initially failing as a farmer, Newton pursued education at Cambridge, where his groundbreaking discoveries emerged, including the development 
        of calculus and his theory of gravitation. His work, particularly in optics and the laws of motion, revolutionized scientific thought and had 
        lasting impacts on future generations of physicists. His major work, Principia Mathematica, established the foundation for classical mechanics. <br><br> 
        Newton’s advancements were not confined to physics alone; his work also extended to alchemy and theology. Although he faced opposition, including 
        disputes with fellow scientists like Robert Hooke and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, his contributions to understanding gravity, planetary motion, 
        and light set the stage for modern physics. Newton’s legacy as a scholar, inventor, and mathematician has endured for centuries, and his name 
        remains synonymous with scientific progress and intellectual achievement.

        The 54th Massachusetts Regiment was one of the first African American regiments to serve in the U.S. Civil War, established in 1863 following the Emancipation Proclamation.      
      </p>

      <div id="moreText" class="hidden-content" style="display: none;">
      <p>
        Led by Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the regiment was recruited from across the U.S. and even Canada, with assistance from abolitionists like Frederick Douglass. 
        Their involvement in the attack on Battery Wagner in South Carolina proved pivotal, showcasing the bravery of Black soldiers despite suffering heavy casualties, 
        including the death of Colonel Shaw. This battle became a symbol of Black military capability and morale. <br><br>
        While the 54th's assault on Battery Wagner was a military loss, it was a political and symbolic victory, boosting the morale of African Americans and proving 
        their worth as soldiers. Following the battle, public perception of Black soldiers shifted, leading to the recruitment of over 180,000 Black soldiers, which 
        was instrumental in the Union's victory. The heroic actions of the regiment, including Sergeant William H. Carney's brave rescue of the American flag, inspired 
        further African American participation in the war effort and helped change the course of the conflict.
