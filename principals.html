                    however the limitations of the individual to develop expertise in all areas and subjects. It is natural to rely on experts in other fields to 
                    lead those fields until which time new evidence can be demonstrated.

                    The SHA understands the first enemy and the last of all individuals and species is death and extinction. We highly value life! The SHA encourages the Union of all peoples 
                    everywhere in recognition of this truth and encourages the species to advance to be able to address all societal ills such as poverty, murder, rape, child victimization, 
                    mental and physical health concerns etc as well as advancing the species to be able to teraform the world to ensure the endurance of life on this planet as well as protecting 
                    it from other universal forces such as asteroids which may cause mass extinction. As such the SHA also encourages the species to advance off of this planet and to inhabit and 
                    explore more of our universe. The SHA makes clear that should this occur and new species are encountered, the interactions of humans with these species are already guided by 
                    and under the protection of the writings in this document.

                    The SHA recognizes the holistic nature of the individual and life in general. We encourage members to avoid vices which may interfere with this nature and impact one’s ability 
                    to meet all of the principles outlined within this document. As such we encourage exercise, reading, time spent in nature, comedy/laughter, art, music, philosophy, history, ethics, 
                    vigorous debate, a healthy sex life and hard work as well as meeting the holistic needs of the relations you have to your others. While the SHA encourages the legalization and 
                    regulation of vices such as gambling, drug/alcohol use, prostitution and use of technology for personal pleasure we discourage our members participation in these activities in access 
                    and without serious consideration for the impact this may have on the individual, their family, and the community and the significant risk that participation can be difficult to 
                    personally regulate and may result in addiction. Participation in these vices should occur in moderation and once all the other needs and responsibilities outlined in this document 
                    have been satisfied and if this cannot be met we advise abstinence.

                    The SHA permits its members to operate in their daily lives from the stance “I am only brave when I have to be”. We do not expect our members to actively seek conflict or situations 
                    that would require self sacrifice but instead we encourage members to maintain a state of physical, mental, emotional, and behavioral readiness that they may protect themselves and 
                    those incapable of protecting themselves when confronted with these realities in their lives. Above all, adult members of SHA must be prepared to protect and sacrifice themselves if 
                    necessary to ensure the security of all children, be they kin or not. We define children as anyone under age 18. Those who do will be elevated to Heroes of Humanity.
